set everything in losers[candidate_count] array to -1 before starting

int losers[candidate_count];
for (int i = 0; i < candidate_count; i++)
{
    losers[i] = -1;
}

let there be some x that starts at 0 and goes up every time we add new person to it
and y to mark the x that was in the previous loop
and z to mark the x after a loop

basically after 1 loop x goes up. z keeps track of its value at the start of the loop
then y takes on z after the loop is executed and z takes on the value of x

bool in_array(int num)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < candidate_count; i++)
    {
        if (losers[i] == num)
        {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

for (int a = 0; a < candidate_count; a++)
{
    for (int i = y; i < x; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < candidate_count; j++)
        {
            if locked[i][j] = true
            {
                losers[x] = j;
                x++;
            }
        }
        y = z;
        z = x;
    }
    if (in_array(pairs[i].winner))
    {
        cycle = true;
        break;
    }
    else if (y = x) //basically in this case no new elements were added
    {
        break;
    }
}
